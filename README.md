# Consumer_Complaints_Analysis
Analysis of consumer complaints data using Excel to identify trends, resolution delays, and operational insights

**Project Summary**

This project focuses on analyzing consumer complaints across various financial institutions in India. The main challenge addressed is understanding patterns in complaints, identifying delays in resolution, and highlighting factors affecting customer satisfaction.

**Objective**

To analyze consumer complaints data using Excel and generate actionable insights that can help financial institutions improve complaint resolution processes and enhance customer experience.

**Approach**
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
Consumer complaints data was collected from multiple financial institutions. The dataset was cleaned in Excel by handling missing values, correcting inconsistent entries, and organizing relevant columns for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Data analysis was performed to understand complaint trends over time, distribution across institutions, types of complaints, and resolution patterns. Pivot tables and charts were used to summarize the findings. Additionally, an interactive dashboard was created in Excel to visualize complaint distribution, top complaint types, and resolution efficiency for easy interpretation.

**Analysis & Visualization:**

Pivot tables were created to identify institutions with the highest number of complaints.

Complaint types were categorized, and trends over time were visualized using charts.

Resolution times were analyzed to identify institutions with delays in addressing complaints.

The Excel dashboard allowed quick access to insights and interactive exploration of the data.

**Results**

The institution with the highest number of complaints was identified.

Complaint types were ranked based on frequency to highlight the most common issues.

Resolution time analysis showed that certain institutions consistently took longer to resolve complaints.

Visualizations (charts, pivot tables, and the dashboard) provided a clear view of complaint distribution and resolution efficiency.

**Key Insights**

Institution with Maximum Complaints: The highest number of complaints came from Bank of America.

**Complaint Types**: Most complaints were related to Loan servicing, payments, escrow account.

**Resolution Delays**:Bank of America,TD Bank US Holding Company, HSBC North America Holdings Inc.,PayPal Holdings, Citizens Financial Group Inc.,
took longer to resolve complaints, indicating operational inefficiencies.

**Patterns Over Time**: There was a noticeable rise in complaints from June to August, followed by a decline from September to December.

**Conclusion**

This project successfully analyzed consumer complaints data using Excel, providing insights that can help financial institutions prioritize complaints, improve resolution times, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

**Future Work**

Incorporating additional data such as customer demographics to identify complaint patterns.

Developing interactive dashboards in Excel or Power BI for real-time monitoring of complaints.

Extending the analysis to cover more institutions and recent complaint data.
